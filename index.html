            <p>A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary
                people, who typically uses his or her powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to
                protecting the public, and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on
                such characters,[1] especially in American comic books since the 1930s (and later Hollywood films), as
                well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime, and video games) since the
                1930s.</p>
